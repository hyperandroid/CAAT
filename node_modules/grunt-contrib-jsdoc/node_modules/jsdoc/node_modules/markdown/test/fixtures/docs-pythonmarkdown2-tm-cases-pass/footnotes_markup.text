This is a para with a footnote.[^1]

This is another para with a footnote.[^2]

[^1]: And the **body** of the footnote has `markup`. For example,
    a [link to digg](http://digg.com). And some code:

        print "Hello, World!"

[^2]: This body has markup too, *but* doesn't end with a code block.
