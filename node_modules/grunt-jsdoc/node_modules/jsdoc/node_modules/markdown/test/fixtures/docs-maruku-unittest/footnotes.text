That's some text with a footnote [^b] and another [^c] and another [^a].

[^a]: And that's the footnote.

    That's the second paragraph of the footnote.


[^b]: And that's the footnote.
This is second sentence (same paragraph).

[^c]:
    This is the very long one.

    That's the second paragraph.


This is not a footnote.
