            <h1>CAAT.Scene</h1>

            <p>The CAAT.Scene object is the main container of animation Actors in a Scene.
                It is an advanced ActorContainer which has two main responsibilities:
                <ol>
                    <li>Knows how to elegantly get out of screen
                    <li>Maintain a virtual timeline for all its contained Actors fed by a Director.
                </ol>

            <p>
                An Scene can not contain neither other Scenes, nor any Director. The size of
                the scene will by default be the same of the Director, and hence, equals to
                the Canvas size, that is, the values passed to director's initialize method.
                The canvas size may vary with the window resize listener thought.</p>

            <p>
                There are two ways of creating an scene:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Manually, by calling <span class="apicode">var scene= new CAAT.Scene()</span>
                        and then adding it to the director by calling
                        <span class="apicode">director.addScene(scene);</span>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The recommended way which is call <span class="apicode">
                        director.createScene()</span> which also adds the scene to the director
                        instance.
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <p>
                The only method the devloper should call directly on Scene instances is
                <span class="apicode">addChild(actor)</span> which adds a new animation
                Actor to the Scene. It can be any kind of ActorContainer or Actor.
            </p>

            <p>There's no limitation regarding the number of elements in an Scene, but for
                better performance, the developer should create groups of actors in containers,
                as if they where in layers. The performance hit is
                strictly on event dispatching to Scene Actors, since the event bubbling will
                try to check for every Actor in a Container (or Scene) if it is the target
                of a concrete event.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Actors on a Scene will keep z-order equally to the same order as they were added to the
                Scene/ActorContainer, so the last added Actor, will be behind all the other Actors.
            </p>
