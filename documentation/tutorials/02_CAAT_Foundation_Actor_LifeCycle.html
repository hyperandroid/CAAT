    <h1>CAAT.Foundation.Actor</h1>
    <h2>Life cycle</h2>
    <p>An actor by default is shown in the Scene as soon as the Scene is showing, and lasts forever.
    But the life cycle can be limited to certain range of time on the <span class="important">Scene timeline</span>.
    By calling the method <span class="apicode">setFrameTime( start_time, duration )</span> an actors lifecycle can
    be controlled.</p>

    <p>
        While the Scene time is less than actor's start_time or the Scene time is bigger than actor's start_time+duration,
        the Actor is considered to be out of frame time. Otherwise the Actor is considered to be in frame time
        and will be processed, have <span class="apicode">beaviors</span> applied and probably be drawn on screen.
    </p>

    <p>
        When the Scene time is greater than Actor.start_time+Actor.duration, besides out of frame time, the actor
        is considered to be <span class="important">expired</span>. This is a readonly property by calling the method
        <span class="apicode">isExpired()</span>.
        An Actor will only be set as Expired once. During this expiration setting, an
        Actor will notify its registered <span class="important">life cycle listeners</span>.
        One of these listeners could for instance reset the Actor's frame time to let the Actor be again in
        frame time.
    </p>

    <p>
        An actor's destroy operation can be delegated to CAAT by flagging an actor as <span class="important">discardable</span>
        by calling the method <span class="apicode">setDiscardable(true)</span>.
        By default an Actor is non discardable.
        This means that at the end of a Director's frame cycle, that is, when finished processing
        and rendering a frame, every Actor that is expired, and flagged as discardable, will be
        thrown away from the scene and properly destroyed.
        This means that the Actor won't be drawn again since it is not
        present at Scene's Actor list anymore. The destroyed actor will also be removed from its parent.
        Upon destruction, the Actor will notify its listeners about this fact by calling the
        <span class="important">listener life cycle</span>.
    </p>

    <h3>Life cycle listener</h3>

    <p>
        An Actor has some methods to expose its lifecycle to third party interested entities.</p>

    <p>
        The actor methods <span class="apicode">addListener( actor_life_cycle_listener )</span>,
         <span class="apicode">removeListener( actor_life_cycle_listener )</span> and
        <span class="apicode">fireEvent( event_type, time )</span> control an actor's lifecycle notification
    </p>

    <p>
        The developer has only control over the add/remove methods, and it is the Director/Scene
        animation cycle that will notify the life cycle changes to interested parties for us by
        calling actor's <span class="apicode">fireEvent</span> method.</p>
    <p>
        The Actor life cycle listener must be an object with a method of the form
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="apicode">
        {
            actorLifeCycleEvent : function( actor_ref, event_type, time) {
            }
        }
            </span>
    </p>


    <p>This method will receive on its parameters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>actor_ref: A reference to the actor that is notifying its life cycle events. It is necessary
            since the developer can reuse the same listener for different Actors, and surely would
            like to know which of them is notifying about the event</li>
            <li>event_type: Event type. It must be one of these string values:
                <span class="important">expired, destroyed</span>.
            The minimum action a life cycle Actor listener must perform is remove himself as listener,
            so that all references to the destroyed Actor are removed and the garbage collector could
            do its job properly.</li>
            <li>time: the Scene time at which the Actor has been destroyed.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Here's some sample code featuring life cycle listener. It is a green-colored pulsating rectangle.
    This Actor is in frame time since the Scene started, and will last for two seconds. After these two
    seconds, the life cycle listener is notified about Actor expiration, which will stablish again
    Actor's lifecycle to start again one second after notification and lasting for two more seconds.</p>
